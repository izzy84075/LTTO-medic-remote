2 signatures per second will gain one health in 15 seconds.(exact)
3 signatures per second will gain one health in 8 seconds.(roughly)
4 signatures per second will gain one health in 5 seconds.(exact)
5 signatures per second will gain one health in 4 seconds.(roughly)
6 signatures per second will gain one health in 3 seconds.(exact)
7 signatures per second will gain one health in 2 seconds.(roughly)

LTTO gear has a counter that, when it reaches 15, will add 1 health. This counter is added to whenever it receives a base heal signature, and is decremented by 1 every second.

All of the following numbers assume a signature takes 32ms, which I think is the maximum for the signatures we would be sending. Should be close enough.

Can get 14 signatures a second with a 39ms(roughly) pause.
Can get 12 signatures a second with a 51ms(roughly) pause.
Can get 10 signatures a second with a 68ms(exactly) pause.
Can get 8 signatures a second with a 93ms(exactly) pause.
Can get 6 signatures a second with a 134ms(roughly) pause.
Can get 4 signatures a second with a 218ms(exactly) pause.

DIP switch will be 'split' in half. First half will select which teams' signatures are sent, second half will select the rate at which the signatures are sent.
	"team" half of DIP switch
		00 - All teams are sent, at the 8 seconds per health rate.
		01 - T0+T1 are sent, at the rate specified by the other half of the DIP switch
		10 - T0+T2
		11 - T0+T3
	"rate" half of DIP switch
		00 - 2 signatures per team per second, 15 seconds per health.
		01 - 3 signatures per team per second, 8 seconds per health.
		10 - 4 signatures per team per second, 5 seconds per health.
		11 - 6 signatures per team per second, 3 seconds per health.
