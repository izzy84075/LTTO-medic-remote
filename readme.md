A simple configurable medic remote for LTTO-compatible taggers and devices!

People keep asking me about making my medic remotes available, but I was never happy with the version they were asking about. This is my answer to both of those.

This medic remote will be(is) capable of functioning as a simple medic remote for RESP/2TRS/3TRS games, but is also capable of functioning as a "healing" base in computer-hosted games. The remote can be configured with a 4-position DIP switch, and the settings are documented on the PCB itself, so you'll never have to go digging for a manual!

These PCBs and the code to go along with them are available under a GPL v2 license. If you would like to modify it, feel free to! Pull requests for useful improvements are accepted! Bug requests are helpful, too!
